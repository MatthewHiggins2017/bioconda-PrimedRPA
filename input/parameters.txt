This parameters file will guide the PrimedRPA-based primer and probe design process. Please follow the instructions outlined below:

----####----
Important Note - Do not remove any of the “>” and write your input directly after this symbol.
----####----


Please define the reference name for this PrimedRPA run:
>SARS-CoV-2-RdRp

Please indicate if you would like to use a previously generated Alignment File: [```NO``` or File path]
>NO

Please indicate if you would like to use the previously generated Binding Sites: [```NO``` or File path]
>NO

Please enter the path, from your current working directory, to the input fasta file:
>input/SARS-CoV-2-RdRp.fasta

Please classify the contents of the input fasta file as one of the following options: for a single sequence enter ```SS```, for multiple sequences enter ```MS``` and for multiple aligned sequences enter ```AMS```:
>SS

If multiple sequences are present in the input fasta file (Classification of MS or MAS), please indicate below the
percentage identity required for the primers and probes target binding sites (just the number):
>99

Please indicate if a primer identity anchor is required [```NO``` or length of anchor]:
>NO

Desired primer length (This can be a range: 28-32 or fixed value: 32):
>28-32

Please state if you require a probe to be designed and if so what type [```NO```, ```EXO```, ```NFO```]
>NO

Desired probe length (This can be a range (```45-50```) or fixed value ```50```):
>50

Below please define your max amplicon length.
>2000

Below please state the repeat nucleotide cut-off in bp (e.g. 5 will exclude sequences containing GGGGG).
>5

Below please insert the minimum percentage GC content for primer/probe (just the number):
>0

Below please insert the maximum percentage GC content for primer/probe (just the number):
>100

Below please indicate the percentage match tolerance for primer-probe dimerisation and secondary structure formation (just the number):
>100

Please enter [```NO``` or ```Path to background.fasta file```] below to identify if you want to perform a background DNA binding check:
>NO

Below please insert the percentage background cross reactivity threshold (just the number):
>65

Below please indicate if you would like to implement a Background Hard Fail Filter [```NO```, ```YES```]:
>NO

Please define the maximum number of sets you would like to identify:
>5

Please define the number of threads available:
>2

Blastn Cross Reactivity Search Settings [Basic or Advanced or Fast]
>Basic

Blastn Evalue
>1000
